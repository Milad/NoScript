Therefore, ordinary users can't disable JS in FF.\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer\r\n=================\r\n\r\nIs not supported right now.\r\n\r\nParticipate\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIf you are a developer, please feel free to help supporting more browsers.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can help testing! I tested the browsers I have. If you have older versions, please test them and update the minimum supported versions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

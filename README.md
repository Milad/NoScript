NoScript
========

NoScript is a CSS-enabled blocking layer that gives website visitors a nicely formatted message to tell them that they need to enable JavaScript in order to use the website properly.

This is for websites that depends on Js so much that they don't offer lightweight versions that work without JS.

If you are a developer, please feel free to help supporting more browsers.

Also, you can help testing! I tested the browsers I have. If you have older versions, please test them and update the minimum supported versions.

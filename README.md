NoScript
========

NoScript is a CSS-enabled blocking layer that gives website visitors a nicely formatted message to tell them that they need to enable JavaScript in order to use the website properly.

This is for websites that depends on Js so much that they don't offer lightweight versions that work without JS.

Please disable your JavaScript in the browser and try the [demo](http://milad.github.io/NoScript/) here.

If you are a developer, please feel free to help supporting & testing more browsers. Also, if you think you can make this better looking, then be my guest.

I tested the browsers I have. If you have older versions, please test them and update the minimum supported versions.
